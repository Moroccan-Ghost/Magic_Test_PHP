<h5>A simple explanation : </h5>
<p>In general for every Value we need to find the step that gives VALUE / X = N ;
with N is 0.1 OR 1 OR 10 OR 1000 ...
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        So firstly we are searching for that X by DIV ( if VALUE > 10 ) or MULTIPLY (IF VALUE < 1 and VALUE > 0) the VALUE by 10
    </li>
    <li>
        After that we do our division and we will find N ( The Step to INC or to DEC)
    </li>
    <li> And before finishing we need to do a simple formatting to the VALUE to get only the first part we need
for exmple : in 11.4 we want only to get 10 so that after INC for exmpl we will get 20 as a result, thats why we will DIV or MULTIP by the variable i depending on the situations below :) and thats all xD
    </li>
    <li>
        This is the shortest coding way to get the solution, the longest way with a complex and long code is the one with JS : https://github.com/Moroccan-Ghost/Magic_Test_JS
    </li>
</ul>
